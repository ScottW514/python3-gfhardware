    A print can be several times longer than the ring: three hours of cutting
    is over 100 MB of steps against 32 MiB of buffer. So the ring is not where
    the job lives, it is a window onto it. Fill the window, start the run, and
    top it up as it drains, which is what the machine's own firmware does.

    ``-ENOMEM`` from the write is the only pacing signal needed: it means the
    window is full, and the answer is to wait and offer the same bytes again.
    The ring holds tens of minutes, so the feeder is never the urgent party.

    Step accounting is deferred to the moments when the ring is full and the
    feeder has nothing else to do, so it can never stand between the machine
    and the bytes it is waiting for.
