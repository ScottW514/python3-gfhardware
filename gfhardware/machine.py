        Reactions during the run - the factory's, both modes alike:
          - lid or interlock loop opens: controlled stop, job cancelled
            (a print then parks; the park itself ignores the lid);
          - service cancel: the same stop;
          - cooling verdict pulled: latch relocked, the same stop;
          - button press (prints only): pause - stop, backtrack
            cloud_pause_backtrack_ticks with the laser off, hold; the
            next press resumes - forward, with the laser re-enabled
            cloud_pause_backtrack_ticks minus cloud_resume_lead_ticks
            short of the pause point, so the beam returns over ground
            the job already cut. A pause in a program's first moments
            retraces as far as the ring holds and leads by the same
            amount less. Lid/interlock/cancel while paused cancel the
            job from where it stands.
          - a live feed that stops making progress while the ring has
            room for it: the same stop and retrace, held until the feed
            moves again, and cancelled rather than left standing if it
            does not. A dry ring is an underrun and a scrapped job; this
            is the same job with a hidden seam.
        The switch thread wakes this loop on every edge, so a reaction
        lands within milliseconds; the level read each pass is the
        backstop for an edge the thread missed.

        ``progress``, when a caller supplies one, reports the run to the
        service: once as it starts, at every pause, resume and hold, once
        more when it ends, and on its own interval in between.
