Glowforge camera capture for the mainline imx-media stack.

The factory firmware drove a single NXP mxc_v4l2_capture node (/dev/video0)
that exposed the sensor controls directly and selected the lid/head camera via
a private V4L2_CID_GLOWFORGE_SEL_CAM control. ForgeFIRM runs mainline
imx-media, which is a media-controller graph: links and per-pad formats must be
configured before the capture node will stream, the sensor controls live on the
sensor subdev (not the capture node), camera selection is the video-mux input,
and there is no flash-LED control -- the bed/head is lit with the lid_led / head
white_led instead.

This module configures that pipeline (via media-ctl / v4l2-ctl) and the lighting
(via gfhardware.leds), then hands the streaming capture node to the _cam C
extension which grabs one frame, debayers it, and JPEG-encodes it. Both cameras
share one video-mux -> MIPI CSI-2 -> IPU CSI path to the 'ipu1_csi0 capture'
video node; only the mux input and the illumination LED differ.

Two sensors ship in the field -- the 5 MP OV5648 and, in "HD" machines, the 8 MP
OV8856 -- and they differ in geometry, bit depth and control set, so the format,
the frame size and the manual exposure/gain come from the profile of whichever
driver bound on that camera's I2C bus (see _SENSORS).

PRIVACY GATE: capture() refuses unless the lid is closed. forgectrl enforces the
same rule on the path everything normally takes; this is the second enforcement
point, for the callers that reach V4L2 directly -- the cloud client's fallback
when forgectrl is unreachable, and the capture utility. Both cameras are gated,
and the check fails closed (see gfhardware.switches.lid_closed).
